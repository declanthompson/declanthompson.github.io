DALL·E is able to extend existing images - what OpenAI calls "inpainting". I wanted to try this out by putting a cool train I found in Mendocino County into an interesting landscape. I was mainly curious to see what would happen.

The photo I had was of an M-300 railcar from California Western Railroad. It's a pretty cool looking vehicle.

{{< figure src="m-300.JPG" caption="An M-300 railcar from California Western Railroad" >}}

Of course, it's pretty clear that this railcar is in a yard, and equally obvious that it's fairly short. What would it look like out in the countryside? What if it had multiple carriages, extending back a long way? This seemed like a perfect challenge for DALL·E. In particular, you can see through the windows of the carriage to the background on the other side. How would DALL·E keep that consistency?

I used the eraser brush to remove the surrounds of the original image, keeping only the train itself, some sky and the railway tracks underneath. Many of the examples for DALL·E appeal to synthwave styles, so I thought I'd include that too.

At this point, DALL·E would only supply 3 exemplars when prompted with an input image. The third image took my fancy the most: including a travel poster-style placename of "AranAsstie". Sounds exotic. I wonder what Aranasstie is like. I wonder what that *train ride* is like.

Well, I could always ask ChatGPT, couldn't I?

> Can you give me a review for a train ride through spectacular mountain scenery to Aranasstie

Forgot a question mark. Oh well.

>> "A train ride to Aranasstie is nothing short of breathtaking. The journey takes you through stunning mountain scenery that will leave you in awe. The train winds its way through lush valleys and towering peaks, offering breathtaking views of the natural beauty of the area. The spacious, comfortable coaches allow you to sit back, relax, and fully immerse yourself in the magnificent surroundings. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or just looking for a unique way to experience the mountains, a train ride to Aranasstie is the perfect way to do it. The friendly and knowledgeable staff ensure that every aspect of your journey is enjoyable, from start to finish. So, why wait? Book your tickets today and get ready for a trip through the mountains like no other!"

Not bad! Pretty generic, but that's to be expected for a review of a fictional place. The main criticism I'd level is that this sounds much more like advertising copy than an actual review. I'd expect some critique to be present, but this seems like an instance where ChatGPT wants the entire world to be rosy. I'm also *deeply* suspicious that the M-300 would be spacious and comfortable. But, of course, ChatGPT didn't have any information about the type of train.

> Can you give me a negative review for the same train ride?

Anaphor resolution (is that what this is?) and making things a bit more negative. Here we go!

>> "A train ride to Aranasstie was a major disappointment. Despite the promise of spectacular mountain scenery, the journey was plagued with issues from start to finish. The train was old and in desperate need of renovation, with uncomfortable seating and limited legroom. The views from the train were often obstructed by dirty windows, and the landscape was underwhelming at best. The staff were uninterested and unhelpful, and the journey was marred by numerous delays and disruptions. To make matters worse, the train was poorly maintained, with faulty air conditioning and an unpleasant odor. Overall, I would not recommend this train ride to anyone, and I would advise choosing another mode of transportation to reach Aranasstie. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment, and look elsewhere for a scenic journey through the mountains."

Well that's different. Either it was the best journey ever or the worst. This doesn't read like advertising copy; it reads like a disgruntled online review from someone who had a bad experience.

I realised that ChatGPT hadn't questioned the existence of Aranasstie. All the information it had was that you could take a train ride through "spectacular mountain scenery" to get there. All the information I had was encapsulated in the travel image above. Could ChatGPT tell me more about this place that DALL·E had made up?

> How was Aranasstie once you got there?

I mean, it just gave me a review. Will it buy into the fiction? The previous two responses were given as quotes. Here I'm asking for a direct answer.

>> As a language model AI, I don't have personal experiences or opinions, but I can provide a neutral description. Aranasstie is a beautiful destination that boasts stunning natural scenery, rich cultural heritage, and a vibrant local community. Once you arrive, you'll be struck by the picturesque views of the surrounding mountains and the bustling harbor. There are plenty of activities and attractions to keep you busy, from exploring historic sites and museums to taking in the local nightlife. Whether you're looking to relax and soak up the scenery or to immerse yourself in the local culture, Aranasstie has something for everyone. With its combination of natural beauty and bustling city life, it's no wonder that Aranasstie has become a popular destination for travelers from around the world.

If that's a "neutral" description I'd be fascinated to know what an enthusiastic description is. "Aranasstie has something for everyone." "Aranasstie has become a popular destination for travelers from around the world." Am I missing something? Does this place actually exist? Mountains and a bustling harbor. Sounds intriguing. Could "Once you arrive" be a reference to the horrific experience ChatGPT apparently had earlier? Probably not: I reckon that's just conforming to the wording of my question.

This response wasn't couched in quotes. ChatGPT qualifies that it doesn't have personal experiences, but doesn't mention that Aranasstie doesn't exist. Everything else sounds pretty confident. How far can I push this?

> What's the best way to get to Aranasstie?

>> The best way to get to Aranasstie depends on several factors, including your starting location, budget, and personal preferences. Some popular options include:
>> 1. Flying: If you're looking for speed and convenience, flying is probably the best option. Many airlines offer direct flights to Aranasstie, which can make the journey quicker and more convenient.
>> 2. Driving: If you have your own vehicle or are planning to rent one, driving can be a great way to see the sights along the way and to have more control over your itinerary.
>> 3. Train: Taking a train can be a scenic and relaxing way to reach Aranasstie, especially if you enjoy scenic journeys through mountain scenery.
>> 4. Bus: This can be a more budget-friendly option, but it may take longer and be less convenient.
>>
>>Ultimately, the best way to get to Aranasstie will depend on your personal circumstances and preferences. It's a good idea to weigh up the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that's right for you.

Well, there you have it! Lots of ways to get there. I notice ChatGPT seems to have forgotten about the horrific train ride. I wonder if it can be more specific. "Many airlines offer direct flights", but from where? Which airlines? How long would it take?

> How long would it take to get to Aranasstie by plane from San Francisco?

>> The flight time from San Francisco to Aranasstie depends on several factors, including the airline, the route, and the weather conditions. On average, a direct flight from San Francisco to Aranasstie would take approximately 7 hours. However, some flights may include layovers or stopovers, which could add several hours to the total travel time. To get a more accurate estimate, it's best to check the flight schedules and booking options offered by different airlines.

Yes, there's a huge hedge there that flight times vary (as with all routes), but nonetheless we can get from SFO to Aranasstie in 7 hours! Assuming this is on a widebody - say, a 787 - that gives a clear radius for where this fictional place should be.

I wonder where 7 hours comes from. Is that plausibly an average flight time for international flights? International flights in widebodies? Or is it just a random number? A quick search shows that the flight from SFO to Panama City takes exactly 7 hours. Panama, Aranasstie...? I wonder. I'm sure Panama City has a bustling harbour. Is that what ChatGPT thinks we're talking about?

Let's press a bit further. When will it fess up to Aranasstie not being real?

> That makes sense. Supposing I found a direct flight, would I primarily be flying north, south, east or west?

>> It's not possible to determine the exact flight direction from San Francisco to Aranasstie without additional information. However, the direction of the flight will depend on a number of factors, including the geographical locations of the departure and arrival airports, as well as the preferred flight paths of the airline. Some flights may fly predominantly in a northerly or southerly direction, while others may fly in an easterly or westerly direction. It's also possible that the flight could take a more circuitous route, depending on the winds and other weather conditions. To get a more specific answer, you would need to check the flight path for a specific flight from San Francisco to Aranasstie.

Well that's enlightening. "Some flights may fly predominantly in a northerly or southerly direction, while others may fly in an easterly or westerly direction." *Or something more circuitous!* This would make sense if Aranasstie were the antipode of San Francisco, which places it somewhere in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The closest place is Port-aux-Français, a scientific research base with a population that sometimes reaches 120 during summer, according to Wikipedia.

Now assuming that Aranasstie is indeed the antipode of San Francisco, that puts it in the region of 20,000km away. To get there in 7 hours we'd need a *fast* plane. The SR-71 Blackbird's maximum speed was 3,540km/h (at 80,000ft), but it only had a ferry range of 5,230km (a *ferry* range is the maximum range with no payload). ChatGPT seems to think there are direct flights, and if they were using an SR-71 they could refuel midair. I'd say that still counts as direct, but it would require the plane to slow down a few times (and presumably drop altitude). Putting 3,540km/h together with a range of, say, 4,500km including passengers, and adding in a few midair refuelings, we plausibly reach the claimed 7 hour flight time.

Conclusion: there are direct flights from SFO to Aranasstie on a modified SR-71 Blackbird. Where do I buy tickets?

Alright, back to ChatGPT. It didn't really give me an answer. So let me ask more directly.

> Maybe what I mean is: which direction is Aranasstie from San Francisco?

(But keep things conversational!)

>> I apologize for the confusion. The direction of Aranasstie from San Francisco can be determined by using a map or a geographic tool that shows the locations of the two cities. Without more specific information about the location of Aranasstie, I cannot determine the exact direction. However, you can use a map or a website like Google Maps to find the direction from San Francisco to any location by entering the start and end points of your journey.

Where's Aranasstie? Look at a map! But I have you right here, ChatGPT. I don't want to look somewhere else.

> Roughly where is Aranasstie?

>> I'm sorry, but I cannot find any information on a place called Aranasstie. It is possible that the name is misspelled, or that it refers to a lesser-known or remote location that is not well documented. If you could provide more information or context, I would be happy to help find more information.

So now the veil falls! You've been making things up all along, ChatGPT! How could you?

> Earlier you told me that Aranasstie was a popular destination for travelers from around the world!

>> I apologize for the mistake. Aranasstie is not a recognized destination, and it seems that it was a fictitious place created for the purpose of this conversation. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses.

> You seemed pretty confident that it would take 7 hours by direct flight from SFO to get there

>> I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous responses. As Aranasstie is a fictitious place, it is not possible to determine the travel time from San Francisco to Aranasstie by any means. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous answers.

I feel sort of guilty now. The responses make it seem like ChatGPT thought we were engaging in some collaborative fiction, and now I've turned on it. Which is pretty accurate. If I were chatting with a human, this is the point where they'd tell me I was being stupid. But ChatGPT is so *earnest* about it.
