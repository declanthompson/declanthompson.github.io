abstract: "A Boolean Network Game is a game played on a network structure. Players choose actions depending on the actions of those in their neighbourhood and attempt to achieve some goal expressed in a modification of Linear Temporal Logic over an infinite run. Iterated Boolean Games are similar, but lack network structure. We define and give translations between these models, and give some complexity results."
