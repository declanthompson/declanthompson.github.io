abstract: "Incompleteness and undecidability have been used for many years as arguments against automatising the practice of mathematics. The advent of powerful computers and proof-assistants – programs that assist the development of formal proofs by human-machine collaboration – has revived the interest in formal proofs and diminished considerably the value of these arguments.In this paper we discuss some challenges proof-assistants face in handling undecidable problems – the very results cited above – using for illustrations the generic proof-assistant Isabelle."
