I'm a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Stanford University, a problem solver with background in formal logic, mathematics, linguistics and computer science. As an excellent communicator, I'm able to synthesize and clearly explain complex concepts. I'm a coder with experience in Java, C, C++, LaTeX, and Python.

I have research projects in foundations of computer science, applied modal logic, game theory, and tools for teaching logic. My dissertation falls under philosophy of computer science; Iâ€™m working on a formal model for general algorithms.

I'm passionate about problem solving: understanding exactly what a given problem is, what a good solution would look like, and how to reach that solution.
