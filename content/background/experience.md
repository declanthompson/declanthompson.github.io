        Proposed and implemented an interdisciplinary research project at the intersecting theory of algorithms, formal verification, programming language semantics, computability theory and philosophy of computer science. Presented research at four international peer-reviewed conferences in logic, in game theory, and in computer science.

        Coordinated with teams of teaching assistants to tutor undergraduate and graduate students in:

      * six introductory and intermediate logic courses, covering up to
      completeness for propositional, first order and modal logic (Phil 250,
      Phil 251, Phil 254);

      * one general analytical philosophy course, covering classic papers in
      free will, the mind-body problem and personal identity (Phil 80);

      * one survey course on philosophy of mathematics (Phil 161).

        Primary instructor for three undergraduate-level courses in formal philosophy:

      * Phil 24E: Philosophy of Algorithms, covering topics in defining
      algorithms, implementation and identity criteria for algorithms, and
      natural algorithms. Co-taught with Ben Sparkes.

      * Phil 49: Survey of Formal Methods in Philosophy, covering topics in
      basic set theory, argument analysis, formal logic (propositional, modal
      and predicate), probability theory, decision theory and game theory. This
      course was targeted at undergraduate philosophy students with no
      background in formal methods. Mean teaching evaluation of 4.25/5.

      * Phil 150: Mathematical Logic, covering basic set theory, Boolean logic,
      modal logic and first-order logic. This course was targeted at
      undergraduate students in philosophy, mathematics, computer science and
      symbolic systems. Mean teaching evaluation of 4.38/5.
