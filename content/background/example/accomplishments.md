  *Supervisor*: Patrick Girard
  
  The purpose of this project was to investigate Ceteris Paribus First-Order
Modal Logic. The aim was to see how such a logic could be defined and what
features it would have. Much research in modern logic focusses on modal logic. In this, modalities
such as *possibly* or *necessarily* are introduced and given a firm footing through Saul Kripke's possible world semantics. Logic of preference applies
modal logic to preferences, where the accessibility relation is understood as a
preference between possible worlds.

Ceteris paribus preferences are preferences which hold, all else being
equal. Ceteris paribus modal logic captures *ceteris paribus* by holding a set of formulas  constant between worlds. 
In this project, we defined a first-order version of ceteris paribus modal
logic.

  Summer Research Scholarships provide the opportunity to gain research experience by pursuing a project with a researcher.
  
  *Supervisors*: Jeremy Seligman and Andrew Luxton-Reilly
  
  This project centred on the development of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/proofassistant/" target="_blank">*Natural Deduction Proof Assistant*</a>, and associated LaTeX package.  Logic is taught in a range of courses at the University of Auckland in both the 
Faculty of Science and Faculty of Arts. Philosophy 222 (Intermediate Logic)
develops students' abilities to complete logical deductions by introducing the
method of Natural Deduction. 
The method of Natural Deduction used in 222 is more abstract than those taught
in other logic courses, and the style taught at Auckland is unique, and so standard textbooks
are inapplicable. The primary goal of this summer research scholarship was to
create an interactive tool to allow faster and easier creation of Natural Deduction
examples and exercises. To this end, two tasks were achieved.
 - First, the method for typesetting examples (using LaTeX) was greatly simplified. The new LaTeX code is more human readable and easier to create.
 - Second, an application written in Java was developed to further aid in the
creation of examples. This application aims to replicate the pen-and-paper
method of Natural Deduction taught in 222. 

The Proof Assistant formed the main part of the project, and has reached a state
that may be useable by students wishing to study further on their own. It has
even been extended beyond the scope of 222 to include a system of modal logic,
hybrid logic and a simple implementation of second-order logic.
