There's two possible talks to give, and I'll decide based on a vote by those present. First, I can discuss Local Fact Change logic. This talk would assume familiarity with modal logic, and cover a number of interesting and well thought through results. Alternatively, I can discuss Rotational Logic. This talk would assume familiarity with propositional logic, and be much more fun, with very poorly thought through conclusions. It's recreational after all.
