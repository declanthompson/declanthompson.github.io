*Dissertation defense*

In this talk I gave a very high-level overview of my dissertation project, focussing on the trace-based account of algorithms I eventually set out.
I spend the first half of the talk providing an informal description of the account, before discussing details of where the challenges lay in defending it.
The talk concluded with a summary of the main contributions of the dissertation.
