summary:
abstract: "Analyses of 'algorithm' as 'effective prodecure' have given us a variety of formal models of computation, which are well understood and extensively studied. Yet instances of these models correspond better with our idea of programs, rather than algorithms. In this talk, I will argue that certain intuitions about algorithms are more properly applied to their implementations, and propose a new direction for an account of 'algorithm' as the word is commonly used."
