summary:
abstract: "The comparative expressive power between two logics is generally measured with respect to the existence of a translation from one to the other. A common technique for showing two logics to have different strengths is by demonstration a pair of models which one of the logics can distinguish, and the other cannot. In this talk, I will demonstrate an instance where these two approaches come apart. The focus will be on comparisons between local fact change and memory logic, two modal logics with model change operators."
