      <title>Formal Characterisations of &#39;Algorithm&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of &lt;em&gt;computable function&lt;/em&gt; has been widely studied in theoretical computer science, and it is often assumed that any questions we have about &lt;em&gt;algorithms&lt;/em&gt; can be answer by using one of the traditional models of computation (Turing machines, recursive functions, etc.). This assumption fails to square with the way &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; is used in computer science practice. When discussing algorithms, we are not merely interested in input/output behaviour, since we mark a distinction between different algorithms for the same task. On the other hand, an algorithm is not a &lt;em&gt;program&lt;/em&gt; or Turing machine, since multiple programs, in different programming languages, can implement the same algorithm. An adequate formal characterisation of &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; has yet to be proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project focusses on analysing the notion of &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt;, with a view to formalising statements like &amp;ldquo;MergeSort runs in $O(n \log n)$ time&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Program $\pi$ implements Algorithm $A$&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Kruskal&#39;s algorithm is correct for the Minimum Spanning Tree problem&amp;rdquo;. Major existing work in this area can be found by authors including Yuri Gurevich, Yiannia Moschovakis and Walter Dean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Games on Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Games played in social networks provide interesting models of numerous social phenomena. In a series of papers, I have investigated properties of &lt;em&gt;Boolean Network Games&lt;/em&gt; and related models. A Boolean Network Game consists of a set of players arranged in a social network, each assigned a formula of modal logic as a goal to be made true. Each player has control over the valuation of propositions at their position in the network. The games are inter-reducible with &lt;em&gt;Iterated Boolean Games&lt;/em&gt;, though with an exponential increase in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tool for studying games such as these, I have investigated &lt;em&gt;Local Fact Change Logic&lt;/em&gt;, a model change modal logic with an operator which changes the valuation at the current world only. The addition of this simple operator causes satisfiability to become undecidable, and model-checking to leap to being PSPACE-complete.&lt;/p&gt;
