It adds a single, innocent-looking model change operator to the basic modal logic, allowing the valuation at a single point in the model to change. This small addition results in undecidability, which can quickly be shown via a satisfaction-preserving translation from memory logic (ML). The lack of a direct translation raises the question of the relative expressive power of LFC and ML. In this talk, I investigate the relative expressive power of LFC and ML. Such comparisons are often made by either providing a direct translation from one logic to the other, or demonstrating a pair of models which one of the logics can distinguish and the other cannot. In the case of LFC and ML, these two approaches come apart. We are left with a somewhat messy picture of how the two compare.","tags":[],"title":"Local Fact Change Logic, Memory Logic and Expressive Power","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The notion of computable function has been widely studied in theoretical computer science, and it is often assumed that any questions we have about algorithms can be answer by using one of the traditional models of computation (Turing machines, recursive functions, etc.). This assumption fails to square with the way algorithm is used in computer science practice. When discussing algorithms, we are not merely interested in input/output behaviour, since we mark a distinction between different algorithms for the same task. On the other hand, an algorithm is not a program or Turing machine, since multiple programs, in different programming languages, can implement the same algorithm. An adequate formal characterisation of algorithm has yet to be proposed.\nThis project focusses on analysing the notion of algorithm, with a view to formalising statements like \u0026ldquo;MergeSort runs in $O(n \\log n)$ time\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Program $\\pi$ implements Algorithm $A$\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Kruskal's algorithm is correct for the Minimum Spanning Tree problem\u0026rdquo;.
