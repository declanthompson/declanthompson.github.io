I wanted to try this out by putting a cool train I found in Mendocino County into an interesting landscape. I was mainly curious to see what would happen.\nThe photo I had was of an M-300 railcar from California Western Railroad. It’s a pretty cool looking vehicle.\nAn M-300 railcar from California Western Railroad Of course, it’s pretty clear that this railcar is in a yard, and equally obvious that it’s fairly short. What would it look like out in the countryside? What if it had multiple carriages, extending back a long way? This seemed like a perfect challenge for DALL·E. In particular, you can see through the windows of the carriage to the background on the other side. How would DALL·E keep that consistency?\nI used the eraser brush to remove the surrounds of the original image, keeping only the train itself, some sky and the railway tracks underneath. Many of the examples for DALL·E appeal to synthwave styles, so I thought I’d include that too.\nA train driving through the mountains with a synthwave sunrise in the background, digital art\nAt this point, DALL·E would only supply 3 exemplars when prompted with an input image. The third image took my fancy the most: including a travel poster-style placename of “AranAsstie”. Sounds exotic. I wonder what Aranasstie is like. I wonder what that train ride is like.\nWell, I could always ask ChatGPT, couldn’t I?\nCan you give me a review for a train ride through spectacular mountain scenery to Aranasstie\nForgot a question mark. Oh well.\n“A train ride to Aranasstie is nothing short of breathtaking. The journey takes you through stunning mountain scenery that will leave you in awe. The train winds its way through lush valleys and towering peaks, offering breathtaking views of the natural beauty of the area. The spacious, comfortable coaches allow you to sit back, relax, and fully immerse yourself in the magnificent surroundings. Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or just looking for a unique way to experience the mountains, a train ride to Aranasstie is the perfect way to do it. The friendly and knowledgeable staff ensure that every aspect of your journey is enjoyable, from start to finish. So, why wait? Book your tickets today and get ready for a trip through the mountains like no other!”\nNot bad! Pretty generic, but that’s to be expected for a review of a fictional place. The main criticism I’d level is that this sounds much more like advertising copy than an actual review. I’d expect some critique to be present, but this seems like an instance where ChatGPT wants the entire world to be rosy. I’m also deeply suspicious that the M-300 would be spacious and comfortable. But, of course, ChatGPT didn’t have any information about the type of train.\nCan you give me a negative review for the same train ride?\nAnaphor resolution (is that what this is?) and making things a bit more negative. Here we go!\n“A train ride to Aranasstie was a major disappointment. Despite the promise of spectacular mountain scenery, the journey was plagued with issues from start to finish. The train was old and in desperate need of renovation, with uncomfortable seating and limited legroom. The views from the train were often obstructed by dirty windows, and the landscape was underwhelming at best. The staff were uninterested and unhelpful, and the journey was marred by numerous delays and disruptions. To make matters worse, the train was poorly maintained, with faulty air conditioning and an unpleasant odor. Overall, I would not recommend this train ride to anyone, and I would advise choosing another mode of transportation to reach Aranasstie. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment, and look elsewhere for a scenic journey through the mountains.”\nWell that’s different. Either it was the best journey ever or the worst. This doesn’t read like advertising copy; it reads like a disgruntled online review from someone who had a bad experience.\nI realised that ChatGPT hadn’t questioned the existence of Aranasstie. All the information it had was that you could take a train ride through “spectacular mountain scenery” to get there. All the information I had was encapsulated in the travel image above. Could ChatGPT tell me more about this place that DALL·E had made up?\nHow was Aranasstie once you got there?\nI mean, it just gave me a review. Will it buy into the fiction? The previous two responses were given as quotes. Here I’m asking for a direct answer.\nAs a language model AI, I don’t have personal experiences or opinions, but I can provide a neutral description. Aranasstie is a beautiful destination that boasts stunning natural scenery, rich cultural heritage, and a vibrant local community.

Such a symbolism is only inconvenient because we are not trained to perceive complicated symmetry about a horizontal axis, and if we adopted it we should be rid of the redundant “not-not,” for the result of negating the sentence “p” twice would simply be the sentence “p” itself. (p161-2) $\\newcommand{\\RR}[2]{\\mathrel{\\style{display: inline-block; transform: rotate(#1deg)}{#2}}}$ $\\newcommand{\\dotcup}{\\mathbin{\\unicode{x228D}}}$ $\\newcommand{\\dotg}{\\mathbin{\\unicode{x22D7}}}$\nRamsey’s observation is a side comment in a larger argument about the nature of relations between propositions, but it suggests a different approach to logical notation. Rather than writing $\\lnot p$, we can write $\\RR{180}{p}$.1 Perhaps surprisingly, this rotated negation extends to more complex formulae, capturing the De-Morgan laws. $$\\RR{180}{(p \\lor q)} \\leftrightarrow \\lnot (p \\lor q) \\leftrightarrow (\\lnot p \\land \\lnot q)$$ Using the standard notation for disjunction ($\\lor$) and conjunction ($\\land$), we can easily read off the meaning of a rotationally negated formula simply by treating all logical connectives as they appear, and rotated propositions as being negated.\nUnfortunately, this happy situation does not remain for other connectives. If $\\supset$ is the material conditional, it is natural to interpret $\\RR{180}{\\supset}$ as the material conditional in the other direction, but this does not correspond to negation. $$\\RR{180}{(p\\supset q)} \\leftrightarrow \\lnot(p \\supset q) \\leftrightarrow (p \\land \\lnot q) \\not\\leftrightarrow (\\lnot q \\supset\\lnot p)$$ Interpreting $\\RR{180}{\\supset}$ simply as the negation of $\\supset$ feels inelegant. Instead, we should hope that the rotated notation intuitively conveys its meaning.\nThis blog post is an attempt to elaborate on what such a rotational notation for logic would look like. During the course of exposition, we will discover a new branch of logic (rotational logic) which deals with invariance properties over permutations of logical connectives.\nRotational Logic Of Ramsey’s observation, we will keep only the idea of rotating formulas. In fact, we will make a great number of changes. Where for Ramsey, rotation gives negation, for us it will merely result in a change of logical connectives, not necessarily negation. Where Ramsey rotated propositional letters, we will keep them upright, and rotate only the connective. Where Ramsey’s formulas were rotated overall ($(p \\lor q)$ becomes $\\RR{180}{(p \\lor q)}$), ours will be rotated in place ($(p \\RR{180}{\\land}q)$ becomes $(p \\land q)$). Finally, where Ramsey employs only 180 degree rotations, we will also utilise 90 degree rotations.\nFormally, the language of rotational logic is defined as follows: $$\\varphi:: = p \\mid (\\varphi\\land\\varphi) \\mid (\\varphi\\supset\\varphi) \\mid {\\varphi}^\\circ \\mid {\\varphi }^\\cdot$$ The notation ${\\varphi}^\\circ$ is understood to mean a single 90-degree rotation of the connectives in a formula. I will abbreviate this by writing: $$\\begin{aligned} {p}^\\circ \u0026amp;= p \\\\ {(\\varphi\\sqcup\\psi)}^\\circ \u0026amp;= ({\\varphi}^\\circ\\RR{-90}{\\sqcup}{\\psi}^\\circ), \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\sqcup$ is any binary operation (in any rotation). The notation ${\\varphi}^\\cdot$ indicates a change in the first truth value in a truth table for each connective. I will abbreviate this by writing a $\\cdot$ inside each connective.\nThe language is fundamentally propositional, so we give semantic definitions in terms of truth tables. The definition of each symbol depends on the rotation of that symbol. We begin with the semantics for the point symbol. $$\\begin{array}{c c | c | c | c | c} \\varphi \u0026amp; \\psi \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\land\\psi) \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\RR{-90}{\\land}\\psi) \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\RR{180}{\\land} \\psi) \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\RR{90}{\\land}\\psi)\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\end{array}$$ As can be seen, the $\\land$ symbol matches closely with the standard conjunction and disjunction symbols. The $\\RR{-90}{\\land}$ symbol can be read as “the truth value on the left”, and $\\RR{90}{\\land}$ can be read as “the truth value on the right”. In this way, the symbols and their rotations align with how we expect them to behave.\nWe have a similar correspondence with $\\supset$, which behaves identically to the material conditional. $$\\begin{array}{c c | c | c | c | c} \\varphi \u0026amp; \\psi \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\supset\\psi) \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\RR{-90}{\\supset}\\psi) \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\RR{180}{\\supset} \\psi) \u0026amp; (\\varphi\\RR{90}{\\supset}\\psi)\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{array}$$ As can be seen, $\\RR{180}{\\supset}$ behaves like material conditional in the other direction. $\\RR{-90}{\\supset}$ is the biconditional and $\\RR{90}{\\supset}$ is binary tautology.\nFor both sets of truth …","date":1678563609,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678563609,"objectID":"0f77ac0f38e1f6b5c6b01e9b23b6fc65","permalink":"https://declanthompson.github.io/blog/blogic/rotational/","publishdate":"2023-03-11T11:40:09-08:00","relpermalink":"/blog/blogic/rotational/","section":"blog","summary":"FP Ramsey makes the following observation in the 1927 “Symposium: Facts and Propositions”:\nWe might, for instance, express negation not by inserting a word “not,” but by writing what we negate upside down.","tags":["rotational logic","logic","fun"],"title":"Rotational Logic","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" A view of the moon in late afternoon from a city park, but the moon is actually the Earth, digital art\nFor this image, I wanted something evocative. I’d been inspired by the numerous example images of astronauts to create an image set in space. I also wanted to see how well DALL·E could interpret clear prompts for specific items, even when the descriptions of those items is somewhat vague. What distinguishes a city park from any other? I don’t know. But the resulting image better be a city park!\nInitial results DALL·E certainly delivered a city park. Again, I’m not sure what that means, but the vibe is definitely right. A lamp post seems to be important. Possibly a fence. Definitely concrete. All the images look to be “digital art”. I particularly like the “brush” strokes in the third image.\nSome features of the original prompt didn’t quite make it. All of these feel much more evening/night than late afternoon. While they all have a moon-like object, only the first image clearly shows this object to be Earth (for some generous sense of “clearly”). The second and third could just as well be the moon, and the object in the fourth image is definitely the moon.\nI find it interesting that the parks are all deserted. My experience of city parks is that they’re over-crowded - especially the sorts of parks depicted here, with large cities in the background. I wonder if the specification that it’s “late afternoon” played a role here.\nExpanding the red bench I was taken by the red bench in the first image DALL·E generated. The contrast in colours was striking. I wanted to see more of the bench! So I asked DALL·E to fill that in using a generation frame. I only preserved the part of the image with the bench in it.\nA red park bench in front of a lonely canal in the city at night, digital art\nThe “lonely canal” was meant to preserve the mood of the original and keep the consistency of the overall image: a canal explains the drop-off to the right of the bench in the original image. I also switched to “night” to stop any strange effects in the sky. Digital art aimed to keep the original style intact.\nThe effect of “red” is immediately apparent. DALL·E seems to have been just as enthusiastic about the contrast as I was, resulting in three images with a sudden change in the brightness of the red bench. This makes for a very clear seam. Intriguingly, the seam is not where the images are actually stitched together: it runs diagonally, but the generation frame has a vertical boundary. The easiest place to see the actual seam is in the third image (the one without a bright-red portion on the bench).\nI believe this phenomenon where there’s something of a change in the style of the image is call “style drifting”. Idea for a future image project: an image of cars drifting with the style of the image drifting across it.\nThe least jarring bench is the one with the same tone of red as in the original image. That bench has water behind it (the canal!) and what looks like a cemetery. I wonder if this cemetery comes from the “lonely” prompt.\nWhat sort of lamp is that? I now had quite a wide image, and I wanted to make it square. But, in particular, I wanted to know what the lamp looked like. What shape might it have? Did DALL·E have good ideas?\nThe moon low in a calm night sky, with a lamp post silhouetted in the foreground, digital art\nIt looks pretty much like the moon in the original picture, even if the colours are suggestive of Earth. I worried that specifying “the moon but it’s actually the earth” would just confuse things. A calm night sky is intended to avoid any billowing clouds or rain. I was interested to see if we’d get any stars by just saying “calm”.\nWell, four different types of lamp. I guess the prompt I gave didn’t offer much room for manoeuvre. Still, there’s some nice variations in the sillhouetted lamp! I really like the very tall pointy one (image 2). The slightly squat third option feels like it fits the setting most though.\nThe remaining corner If you’re keeping track, you’ll know that I’ve outpainted the original image to the left and up. That leaves the top left corner unfilled. Now the goal is to fill it. At first I thought I’d try to add to the atmosphere of the image.\nA foreboding night sky above silhouetted tree-tops, digital art\nUnfortunately, “foreboding” is strongly associated with bad weather, so DALL·E tried its best to include some clouds. That meant a change in the style of the sky, with a clear seam. So I tried to make sure the colouration would remain consistent:\nA dark night sky above silhouetted tree-tops, digital art\nThe first four images are “foreboding”, the second four are “dark”.\nThey’re all pretty boring, but that’s what I was expecting. The biggest challenge is finding a seamless outpainting. The 6th image seems to be the best (seams to be?), so that’s what I went with.\nThe final image Putting all the pieces together, we have an image of a city park at night.\n","date":1678406158,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678406158,"objectID":"13b6ddd5ed165e2d90dd506e68910a97","permalink":"https://declanthompson.github.io/blog/aiart/citypark/","publishdate":"2023-03-09T15:55:58-08:00","relpermalink":"/blog/aiart/citypark/","section":"blog","summary":"For this image, I wanted something evocative.

On the other hand, an algorithm is not a program or Turing machine, since multiple programs, in different programming languages, can implement the same algorithm. An adequate formal characterisation of algorithm has yet to be proposed.\nThis project focusses on analysing the notion of algorithm, with a view to formalising statements like “MergeSort runs in $O(n \\log n)$ time”, “Program $\\pi$ implements Algorithm $A$” and “Kruskal’s algorithm is correct for the Minimum Spanning Tree problem”. Major existing work in this area can be found by authors including Yuri Gurevich, Yiannia Moschovakis and Walter Dean.\n","date":1578268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578268800,"objectID":"bcce5ac31844ea0249ff1907917829b2","permalink":"https://declanthompson.github.io/project/algorithms/","publishdate":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/algorithms/","section":"project","summary":"Finding a characterisation of 'algorithm' that matches everyday usage.","tags":["algorithms","philosophy of computer science","algorithmic analysis","Turing machines","ASM","recursors"],"title":"Formal Characterisations of 'Algorithm'","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571214600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571214600,"objectID":"4c4eb14695927d1818e9ffb5a5f682a0","permalink":"https://declanthompson.github.io/talk/tsu_19-10-06/","publishdate":"2020-09-04T12:39:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tsu_19-10-06/","section":"talk","summary":"The comparative expressive power between two logics is generally measured with respect to the existence of a translation from one to the other. A common technique for showing two logics to have different strengths is by demonstration a pair of models which one of the logics can distinguish, and the other cannot. In this talk, I will demonstrate an instance where these two approaches come apart. The focus will be on comparisons between local fact change and memory logic, two modal logics with model change operators.","tags":[],"title":"Local Fact Change Logic, Memory Logic and Expressive Power","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Games played in social networks provide interesting models of numerous social phenomena. In a series of papers, I have investigated properties of Boolean Network Games and related models. A Boolean Network Game consists of a set of players arranged in a social network, each assigned a formula of modal logic as a goal to be made true. Each player has control over the valuation of propositions at their position in the network. The games are inter-reducible with Iterated Boolean Games, though with an exponential increase in size.\nAs a tool for studying games such as these, I have investigated Local Fact Change Logic, a model change modal logic with an operator which changes the valuation at the current world only. The addition of this simple operator causes satisfiability to become undecidable, and model-checking to leap to being PSPACE-complete.\n","date":1570665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570665600,"objectID":"a1bb7018e5d347a1da112168e8b6b95a","permalink":"https://declanthompson.github.io/project/bng/","publishdate":"2019-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bng/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring the interaction between logic and game theory, in games played on social networks.","tags":null,"title":"Games on Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"There’s two possible talks to give, and I’ll decide based on a vote by those present.
